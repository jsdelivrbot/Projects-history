## General guidelines

## Guideline for creating shared components
- Try to create as many shared components as possible.
- Before creating any shared component make sure that it's not already exists.  
- Create the storybook documents for the shared component by using the existing storybook files.
- Share these shared components as soon as they are ready to other developers by merging them to master.

## Some Important general points to Remember
- Comment everything in JavaScript. It includes function and individual statements. ***Important***
